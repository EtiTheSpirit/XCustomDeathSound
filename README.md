# XCustomDeathSound
Custom Death Sound Mod for Starbound!

# If you want to use this

Do **not** append this directly into your mod. Instead, perform the following:

1) Go into your Species file and add a `deathNoises` index (preferrably under `ouchNoises` for organization, but this is on you). This should include an array of sounds that will randomly play when your species dies.
2) Ask your players to install the custom death sounds extension mod from here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1695298616

##### n.b. directly adding this into your mod *will* cause conflicts if other mods do the same thing, namely via multiple death sounds playing at once.
